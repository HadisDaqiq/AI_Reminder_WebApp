# AI_Reminder_WebApp
This is a web app using Python and Django for the back end. 
This project started with an idea to develop a smart reminder application where the user is automatically reminded 
of tasks she needs to complete based on her location. The application tracks the user’s location and learns 
what tasks she completes as she moves around. The application, by gathering information from the user’s “to do” 
list and registering where she is when she checks off items, using Machine Learning techniques, soon learns 
what tasks the user completes at what locations. Then, next time the user goes to the same location, 
the application sends a notification to the user reminding her of the task she needs to complete at that location.  
For, instance last week Ali went to the library several times to print her Biology Lab. 
Today, as she walks in to the library to study, she is reminded that she needs to print her Biology Lab as well since
she is in the library. There are a lot of apps where the user can enter reminders and check them off.
This project is starting from there. The user walks in to the library and does something like print her Biology Lab and 
then she checks off that reminder on her phone.  The application is going to attach that location to the reminder. 
The application learns that the user is in the library and she printed her Biology Lab. Ali repeats this process a few times.
What does the app do?So now three days later Ali walks back into the library, and then the app detects the user’s location 
and says “wait” several times. “You have a Bio Lab to check off.” And I see a reminder that you are suppose 
to print out a paper. Gathering and learning from this information the application pings the user and 
reminds her to print out her Biology Lab.
